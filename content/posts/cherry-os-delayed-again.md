So, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cherryos.com">CherryOS</a> was supposed to be available for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,65437,00.html">download on Nov. 25th</a>, but it looks like it has been delayed again. I still think this is a hoax. Would be pretty cool if it was real though.<br />
