<p>I turned 0x23 yesterday and my wife gave me an <a href="http://ipod.com/" target="_blank">iPod</a> for my birthday. It took me a while to figure out which MP3 player I wanted, until I played with a few at Best Buy. The iPod really does have a great user interface! So, I've started using <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" target="_blank">iTunes</a> for Windows and I have to say, it is a really nice player/manager for MP3s.</p>
