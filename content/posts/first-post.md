My instance of Orchard crapped out on me a couple of days ago. I was hosting it on Azure and I think they updated to .NET 4.5 and the version I was using didn't work with it. Tried updating a local copy of my site to the latest version of Orchard over the last couple of days with no luck. I figured since I was going to have to start from scratch anyway, maybe I should try out a different CMS. Well, WordPress it is. I figure it is the most mature CMS out there and shouldn't give me too many problems. Now I just need the find the right combination of theme and plugins...
