        <P>A few months ago I went to the <A href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks!</A> Roadshow event here in Phoenix. It was a great show and I ended up winning "some really cool PDA/Phone device from Cingular". Apparently, Cingular hadn't even finalized what the device would be so the winners were told we would find something out around the end of December.&nbsp;It was suggested that the device might be an <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/09/23/hp-ipaq-hw6715-in-the-flesh/">iPAQ 67xx</A>.</P>
<P>Well, December turned into February and the iPaq turned into the <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/12/12/cingulars-2125-hits-the-web/">Cingular 2125</A>. I decided to unlock it so I could try it out with my T-Mobile account. It worked great, but I was really looking forward to a pocket PC Phone with a QWERTY keyboard. So, I decided to <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5870749681&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&amp;rd=1">sell it on eBay</A>.</P>
<P>After I sell it I will be buying a <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/21/mda-now-officially-really-actually-available-from-t-mobile/">T-Mobile MDA</A>. I tried one out at the local T-Mobile store and it is a lot smaller than I expected and&nbsp;the slide-out keyboard seems to work pretty nice.</P>
<P>So, if you are looking for an unlocked Cingular 2125, head on over to my <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5870749681&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&amp;rd=1">auction</A> and bid!</P>
