<p>Well, that was quicker than I had originally plannedâ€¦</p>  <p>Change Log:</p>  <p>1.14:</p>  <ul>   <li>Bugfix - Found another bug which was causing feeds to be deleted if they were being saved while the app is shutting down. Now the most that can be lost are the feed items.</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://markpit.com/MyFeeds" target="_blank">MyFeeds</a></p>
