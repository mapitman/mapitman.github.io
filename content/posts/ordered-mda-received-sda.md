<P>Well, I received a phone yesterday from <A href="http://t-mobile.com">T-Mobile</A>. Not the phone I ordered, but a different one. I received the T-Mobile SDA. According to this <A href="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?t=868182">thread</A> on <A href="http://www.howardforums.com">Howard Forums</A>, about 800 people who ordered MDAs got SDAs instead! Someone from T-Mobile is supposed to be calling me in the next day or two to straighten it out. I won't hold my breath...</P>
