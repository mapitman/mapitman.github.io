<p>Surprisingly, EPSON released a <a title="Vista driver" href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=23762&amp;prodoid=35836299&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows" target="_blank">Vista driver</a> a while back for my scanner, which is a couple of years old. The download page says it is a 32 bit driver, but it seems to work just fine with Vista x64. This is really good news because I was contemplating moving back to 32 bit. Now I think I will tough it out. I am hoping <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> will release a new video driver soon. I am getting a little tired of the video driver &quot;stopping and recovering&quot; itself every 15 to 30 minutes. It seems to happen more often when I have my external display attached.</p>
