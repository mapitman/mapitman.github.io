Thirty two years ago I got my first computer. It was an [Apple II+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series) and I loved it!
![Apple \]\[+](/images/2015/01/AppleII-MonitorIII-1.jpg)  
It had a green screen, dual 5.25" floppy drives and 48K of RAM. Yes, that is 48 _kilobytes!_

I spent most of that summer teaching myself to program in BASIC and playing a few games like [Choplifter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter), [Apventure to Atlantis](http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2014/01/game-129-apventure-to-atlantis-1982.html) and [The Tarturian](http://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/tarturian).

The Tarturian was particularly bad. It would crash once in a while and dump you to the command line. It was written in BASIC and I remember going through the code and trying to fix the bugs!

Check out the awesome graphics!

A couple years later my dad brought home an IBM PC from work. It was quite a bit different and at first I didn't really like it. A few years later, I got my first laptop when I started college. It was a Zenith Data Systems (yes, _that_ Zenith) [ZWL 183](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/24719/Zenith-Laptop-Computer-ZWL-183-92/). It had a blue and gray LCD screen, a 3.5" floppy drive, a 20 MB hard drive and 640K of RAM. It ran at 8 Mhz compared to the 4.77 MHz of the IBM PC. I actually had to slow down the processor to play some games!

This thing was the size of a briefcase and had a slide out handle so you could carry it like one as well!

Fast forward to today and I've mostly been a PC/DOS/Windows user ever since. I've dabbled in Linux, FreeBSD and other UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems as well. I really like Linux. I am a command-prompt guy at heart and the Bash shell is great. I've tried to use Linux as my main OS many times over the years, but there was always some piece of hardware that kept me from making the switch.

When I started looking for a new laptop recently, my plan was to get something in the 13 - 14 inch range with 16 GB of RAM so I could run Linux and use VirtualBox to emulate Windows for the few Windows applications I need, like Visual Studio. Here's the problem though: _There are no 16 GB Windows laptops that I would consider lugging around!_ I looked at Acer, ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, Razer, Samsung, Toshiba and ...  Apple. I kept finding myself going back to the Macbooks when I would look at laptops at Fry's or Best Buy. They are just built so well. A few guys at work recently made the switch and had nothing but good things to say about their Macs. So, 32 years after my first Apple computer, I've bought my second one!

I ended up getting a Macbook Pro 13" Retina with a 2.8 GHz i7 and 16 GB RAM. I don't buy new laptops very often, so I'm willing to spend a little more when I do. This is replacing a circa 2007 Lenovo ThinkPad X61T Tablet PC, so I'm a little overdue!

I considered getting a Mac years ago when they switched to a BSD based operating system. I considered it even more when they switched to Intel processors since I figured I could run Windows on it if I didn't like OS X. They always seemed so expensive though, and I believed the hype at the time about how they were "_overpriced_." Looking back, I ended up spending just as much or more for comparable (or more likely inferior) PC hardware.

I'm looking forward to my next computing adventure with my new Macbook Pro!
