My friend Wade has made a few changes in his life recently. He started <A href="http://www.bloggingit.com/wadew" target=_blank>blogging</A>, <A href="http://bloggingit.com/wadew/archive/2004/06/18/146.aspx" target=_blank>moved his family to Washington</A> and started a new job at Microsoft! Congratulations Wade!
