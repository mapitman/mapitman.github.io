        I have used Flash 5 in the past to author autorun executables for CD-ROMs. 
It is nice because it is easy and there is no runtime required. Macromedia has 
basically <A href="http://www.northcode.com/links/mxproject.html" target="_blank">killed this 
usage with Flash MX</A> though. You can't execute apps unless they are in a "fscommand" 
subdirectory and you can't pass commandline arguments to those apps either. 
Thanks a lot Macromedia!
