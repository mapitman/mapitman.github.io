<p>After spending a bunch of time trying to get Ubuntu all <a href="http://markpit.com/blog/2007/06/18/UbuntuLinuxInstalled.aspx">configured how&nbsp; I wanted it</a>, I still couldn't get my MDA to sync with Evolution. So, I am back on XP on my main system. Hopefully I can keep it free from software bloat this time.</p>
