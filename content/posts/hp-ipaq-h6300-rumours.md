Is anyone else as excited as I am about this rumoured <A href="http://www.brighthand.com/article/RumorMill_-_h6300_Found_in_Wireless_Carrier-s_Database?site=PPC">Pocket PC Phone</A> from HP? Not too sure if I'm ready to shell out the estimated $600 to buy it, but with some luck, maybe T-Mobile will have some kind of rebate on it :)
