        It turns out that the Red Ring of Death was not a <a href="http://markpit.com/blog/2007/06/28/XBOX360RedRingOfDeath.aspx">one time deal</a>.

So, I have sent it off to the XBOX Service Center in McAllen, TX. They say it will be 4 - 6 weeks before I get it back. Looks like they received it today. Does anyone know what they do exactly for this problem?<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/XBOX" rel="tag">XBOX</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
