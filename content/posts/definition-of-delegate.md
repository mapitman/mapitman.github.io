        <P>Jeff Putz <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/archive/2004/03/22/94005.aspx">asks</A>&nbsp;for help defining delegates.</P>
<P>At DevDays 2004 in Phoenix, Rob Bagby of <A href="http://www.dotnext.net/">DotNeXt</A> had an interesting definition of delegates. He said a delegate is like &#8220;Huggy Bear&#8221; from Starsky and Hutch. When Huggy got some information, he passed it off to Starsky and Hutch. There was more to it, but that is what I can remember of it. Wish he had a blog, I really liked his presentation.</P>
<P>Some people would say a delegate is a pointer to a function, but that isn't really the case. When a delegate gets called, it could wind up calling multiple methods, instead of just one. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.</P>
