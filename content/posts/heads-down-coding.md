Eric Gunnerson gets to spend most of the week <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/05/05/126890.aspx">"App Building"</a>. Sounds like fun! I really enjoy when I get to work heads down on a project for a few days. No meetings, no administrative tasks, just pure coding time! As it turns out, it looks like I'll get close to that for the next couple of days at work.
