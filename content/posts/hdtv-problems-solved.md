A while back I [talked](/hdtv-in-phoenix) about no longer being able to pick up certain&nbsp;channels on my HDTV. Well, thanks to a suggestion from my friend Robert, I bought a [Terk HDTVi](http://www.terk.com/HDTVi.html) antenna. I plugged it in and ran the channel auto-discover on my TV and it brought back PBS and the local NBC HD signals! This antenna works __much__ better than the amplified antenna I was using before. I watched 3 hours of HD broadcast tonight, Lost and Alias :), and I had no signal dropouts like I usually did with my old antenna. Best $40 I've spent in a while!
