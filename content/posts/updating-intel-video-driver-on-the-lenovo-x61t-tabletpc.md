<p>Lenovo's latest video driver for the X61T is dated sometime in June. I've been having a lot of problems with my video driver &quot;stopping&quot; and &quot;recovering&quot;. It gets pretty annoying. The driver installer on Intel's site won't install on the X61T. It says to get the driver from the OEM.</p>  <p>I took a look on Intel's site again recently to see if there was another way to get the drivers and I noticed a zip file you can <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&amp;ProductID=2800&amp;strOSs=160&amp;submit=Go%21" target="_blank">download</a>.</p>  <p>Once I got the drivers extracted I went into Device Manager and updated the drivers manually. I haven't had a video driver stop message for about a week now, so it looks like these drivers fixed my problem. By the way, this is Vista X64.</p>
