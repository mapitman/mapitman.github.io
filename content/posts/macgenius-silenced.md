Looks like the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/themacgenius/" target="_blank">MacGenius</a>, a blog written by an Apple "Genius" has been shut down. This was no sugar-coated blog, he was pretty blunt about things going on at the Apple Store. I wonder if he did it on his own or if he was asked to take it down?&nbsp; Only got 4 posts up before shutting down!<br />
