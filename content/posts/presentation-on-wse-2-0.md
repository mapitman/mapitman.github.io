        <P>I went to a presentation last night at the <A href="http://azgroups.org/Asp.Net/Page.Home.aspx">AZ ASP.NET User Group</A> meeting. It was on <A href="http://www.dasblonde.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=27808162-736f-45e4-9d8a-c54aa9372865">Web Services Security with WSE 2.0</A>. WSE is something that I&nbsp;have heard about, maybe even read a little about, but I haven't taken the time to really learn about it so I figured this would be a good way to get into it. The speaker was $g(Michele Leroux Bustamante)&nbsp;and she&nbsp;did an excellent job. I&nbsp;didn't nod off at all :) The timing on this was perfect. I was just writing a web service that I wanted to secure and I started down the road of using Forms Authentication in ASP.NET. That just turns out to be a big pain. WSE looks like it handles the problem quite nicely.</P>
<P>By the way, if anyone didn't know, the guy on her t-shirt is Bob Dobbs from&nbsp;the <A href="http://www.subgenius.com">Church of the Subgenius</A>.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
