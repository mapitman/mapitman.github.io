A user suggested being able to set the default view in the article list. I thought it was a good idea, so I pushed out a quick update. Here's what's new:
<ol>
	<li>Improved article HTML rendering.</li>
	<li>New option to set <i>Unread </i>or <em>All </em>as default in article list view.</li>
	<li>App was crashing intermittently when editing properties of a feed - Fixed!</li>
</ol>
