        From <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx">S. 
      "Soma" 
     Somasegar's blog</a>:<br><br>"<font size="2">The .NET Framework 3.0 is still comprised of the
existing .NET Framework 2.0 components, including ASP.NET, WinForms,
ADO.NET, additional base class libraries and the CLR, as well as new
developer-focused innovative technologies in WPF, WCF, WF and WCS".<br>...<br></font>"We are confident that this change will go a long way towards reducing confusion people may have about our developer platform and the technologies in which they should invest."<br><br>Are you kidding me? You really think this will <i>reduce</i> confusion? If the next version of the compilers is not going to be ready when Vista and all the W*Fs ship, then just keep the name WinFX for now. When C# 3.0 is ready, upgrade the whole thing and call it .NET Framework 3.0 if you must. Much less confusing if you ask me.<br><br>And as for the question, "<font size="2">WinFX sounds great, but what happens to .NET?" It amazes me that any developer has been asking that. If they can't understand that, their heads are going to explode with all this version mix-matching business.<br></font><p></p>
