I flashed my Linksys BEFSR41 v2 router to firmware 1.45.7. That was a mistake. Every few hours it would require a reset. I couldn't even get to the configuration web page. I turned off UPnP and that seems to help a bit, but I still had to reset once today. I am going to keep shutting stuff off until I get it stable. If that doesn't work I'll try downgrading the firmware.&nbsp;<A href="http://www.linksys.com/"><B>Linksys</B></A>, are you <A href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/7779&amp;vid=117014"><B>listening</B></A>
