I have noticed over the past few weeks that there is something wrong with the sound on our&nbsp;<A href="http://knxv.com/">Phoenix ABC affiliate's</A> HD broadcast. When a network show like Lost or Alias is on, it sounds like the audio is inside a tube. Kinda of a metallic ring to it almost. When advertisements or local programming are on it sounds fine. I don't hear this on any other channels. I wonder what is going on. I wonder if anyone else is hearing it.
