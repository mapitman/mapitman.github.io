about the record labels wanting more money for songs when sold through
the iTunes Music Store. One of the reasons they state is because less
people are buying the full CDs and just buying the songs they want, so
they are making less money. I wonder though, if Jobs refuses to
increase the price on songs, will the big record labels stop producing
full "albums"? There always seems to be a few songs on a CD that are
destined to become singles and then there are other songs that maybe
don't fit the "format" for a hit single. Will the record labels force
artists to only churn out "hits"? I hope not. Whenever I have bought a
CD in the past for a couple of songs that I had heard on the radio, I
almost always found other songs on it that I never would have heard on
the radio, but I liked a lot.
