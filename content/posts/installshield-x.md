Installshield has <a href="http://www.installshield.com/products/x/" target="_blank">released InstallShield X</a>! I was lucky enough to be invited to a beta lab&nbsp;at InstallShield's <a href="http://www.installshield.com/company/locations/map.asp" target="_blank">Schaumburg headquarters</a> in March. From what I saw there, this looks like it is going to be a great upgrade! If you create installers that install IIS websites or need to run SQL scripts against MS SQL Server, I highly suggest you take a look at this release.
