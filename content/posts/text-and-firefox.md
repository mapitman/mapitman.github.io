<P>I'd like to get my blog looking better in <A href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" target=_blank>Firefox</A>. I found a little tip <A href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/posts/203.aspx" target=_blank>here</A>, but it still isn't perfect. I haven't done any serious cross-browser development in years, so I'm not even really sure why it is messed up in Firefox. Guess I'll have to do some experimentation and see what happens.</P>
