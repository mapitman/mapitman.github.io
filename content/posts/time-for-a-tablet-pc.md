<p>Looks like Tablet PCs just might be ready for developers to use. Two different developers have blogged a little bit about their new Tablet PCs <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/PermaLink,guid,0789c0c0-88e2-4e80-8a8e-52e949e55584.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.davidmcnamee.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5c166f02-c18a-40a3-8f46-c86ff257a0cb="" target="_blank">here</a>. I really need a new PC for personal use. I have a laptop for work, but I always do my personal projects on my personal PC. I was thinking about getting a laptop to replace my current desktop, but the more I read about Tablet PCs, the more I want one!</p>
