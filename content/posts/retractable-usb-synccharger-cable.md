If you have a PDA and a laptop, or you sync with multiple PCs, <A href="http://meritline.com/ultra-portable-retractable-cable.html" target=_blank>this cable</A> is great. It will handle syncing and will also charge your PDA right from the power supplied by the USB port. I ordered one on the 6th and received it the 8th. I'm pretty happy with <A href="http://meritline.com/" target=_blank>Meritline.com</A>. The cable was only $15 including shipping and they shipped it the same day I ordered it.
