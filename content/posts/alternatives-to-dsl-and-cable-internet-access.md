<p>I live in the Phoenix area (Chandler to be exact)&nbsp;and currently use <a href="http://www.cox.com/phoenix/HighSpeedInternet/" target="_blank">COX High Speed Internet</a>. I am basically happy with it, but I have been wondering what my alternatives are. There are a lot of limitations with COX, no access to external SMTP servers, very limited upstream speeds, just to name a couple. I see that SpeedChoice (Sprint) <a href="http://www.speedchoice.com/" target="_blank">isn't taking any new customers</a>. Besides Qwest DSL (yuck!) what are my choices?</p>
