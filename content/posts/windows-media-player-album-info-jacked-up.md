        <P>OK <A href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>, what's the deal? I put <A href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=outkast">OutKast's</A> &#8220;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&#8221; Disc 2 in my CDROM drive to rip the tracks and when <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/player.aspx">Media Player</A> downloads the track info about half the tracks are in the wrong order?!?! There is even one completely missing! So, I went to the All Music Guide website to see if they had them in the right order and they do, except for that missing track. I'm pretty sure that is where Media Player gets its info from, so what's going on? </P>
<P>Next thing I did was click on &#8220;Find Album Info&#8221;, that found the tracks in the right order, except for that elusive missing track again. So I just shifted the last few track titles down one and typed in the missing title for track 17 and it is all fixed, but it is still annoying that I even had to do it!</P>
