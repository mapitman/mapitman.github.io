<p>So I was trying to get to the <a href="http://www.opennetcf.org/" target="_blank">OpenNETCF.org</a> website and it seems to be down at the moment. Then later on tonight I tried the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/" target="_blank">CodeProject</a> site and it seems to be hosed too! Looks like CodeProject is having a problem with their database server:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>We were not able to process your request: <blockquote><ul><li><font color="red">Unable to locate main database</font></li></ul></blockquote><ul><li><b>Forgotten your password?</b> Click <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/profile/forgot.asp">here</a>. <li><b>Other problem?</b> Try the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/profile/faq.asp">FAQ</a>. </li></ul><p>Please press the <a href="javascript:history.back()"><b>back</b></a>-button in your browser, check or adjust your entries and then retry.</p><p>If the problem persists please <a href="mailto:webmaster@codeproject.com">contact us</a>.<!-- Main Page Contents End --></p></blockquote><p>Not sure exactly what's going on with the OpenNETCF site, but According to <a href="http://blog.opennetcf.org/ctacke" target="_blank">Chris Tacke</a>, it is some sort of <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;threadm=OAAF4HuMEHA.140%40TK2MSFTNGP09.phx.gbl&amp;rnum=1&amp;prev=/groups%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26scoring%3Dd%26q%3Dopennetcf.org%2Bsite%2Bgroup%253Amicrosoft.public.dotnet.framework.compactframework%26meta%3Dgroup%253Dmicrosoft.public.dotnet.framework.compactframework="" target="_blank">DNS snafu</a>. Hope they both get their problems fixed soon! It <em>really</em> sucks when reference sites like these go down! Especially OpenNETCF, some of the examples they have their are pretty unique to their site!</p>
