<p>So, I'd really like to get a bluetooth enabled wireless phone so I can check email, surf the web, etc. while away from home or the office. I currently have AT&amp;T wireless and I think I would switch to another provider in order to get some kind of deal on a phone. But which company to switch to? So far, it seems like the only option in the Phoenix area is T-Mobile. I don't see <em>any</em> bluetooth phones being offered by <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/" target="_blank">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.alltell.com/" target="_blank">Alltell</a> or <a href="http://www.sprintpcs.com/">Sprint</a>. T-Mobile has two phones with bluetooth, the <a href="http://www.infosync.no/news/2002/n/2270.html" target="_blank">Nokia 3650</a> and the <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/3170.html" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson T610</a>. The 3650 is about a year and a half old and the T610 is about a year old! What's going on? Where's all the technology we have been promised? The T610 seems like a pretty decent phone, but I'd really like something in a clamshell format. There's no way I would subject myself to the 3650's retro, bizarro keypad! Of course, if HP would just <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=2625="">release the iPAQ 6300</a> series Windows Mobile Phone, I would be all set!</p>
