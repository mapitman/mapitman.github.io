I just received an email stating that MyFeeds 2.3 was certified in the Windows Phone Store. It should be available within the next day. This is a maintenance release.
<ul>
	<li>Fixes crashes on Windows Phone 8 devices while feeds are updating.</li>
	<li>Allows application settings to be reset to the defaults.</li>
</ul>
Get it <a title="MyFeeds for WIndows Phone" href="http://bit.ly/MyFeedsWP" target="_blank">here</a>!
