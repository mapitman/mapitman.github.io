        Went to the <A href="http://www.asp.net/roadshow/" target=_blank>ASP.Net 
Roadshow</A> presentation in Phoenix tonight. <A href="http://scottgu.com/" 
target=_blank>Scott Guthrie</A> presented. It was a really good session. The 
only complaint I have is that 30 to 45 minutes were spent on an intro to 
ASP.Net. ASP.Net has been around for over 2 years, we don't need an intro 
anymore. If someone&nbsp;attending one of these presentations doesn't know the 
basics by now, maybe they should read a book or something! I enjoyed his tips 
and tricks section and definitely enjoyed seeing what is coming in ASP.Net 2.0 
and Visual Studio 2005. Plus, everyone who attended received a copy of <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/6578.asp" target=_blank>ASP.NET 
Coding Strategies</A>. Not too shabby!<div><p>[Now Playing: David Bowie - Best of Bowie [Virgin US/Canada]  - Ashes to Ashes [Single Version] - 03:38]</p></div>
