Seems like everyone is going nuts over Gmail. Its mail, big deal. OK, they do offer quite a bit of space, but do you really need (or want) to keep 1 GB of mail hanging around? Sure, it has a search feature, but I can search my mail in Outlook now. What's better about Gmail's search?&nbsp;I'm not trying to be smart, I really would like to hear about it.&nbsp;<A href="http://gmail-is-too-creepy.com/" target=_blank>This site</A> has some interesting things to say about it... Seems a <EM>little</EM> paranoid, but they do have some points.
