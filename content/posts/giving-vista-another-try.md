<P>Epson released a Vista driver for my scanner, a <A href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=23762&amp;prodoid=35836299&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows" target=_blank>Perfection 1670</A>, so I decided to give Vista another go. There&nbsp;has also been a new <A href="http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/vista32/common-vista32.html" target=_blank>ATI Catalyst driver</A> release since the last time I installed, so maybe this one will work!</P>
