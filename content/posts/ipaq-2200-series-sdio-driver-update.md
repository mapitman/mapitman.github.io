HP has released an <A href="http://h18007.www1.hp.com/support/files/HandheldiPAQ/us/download/20674.html" target=_blank>update</A> for the iPAQ 2200 Series. It fixes some power consumption problems with SDIO devices and a &#8220;SD Card initialization issue&#8221;. Whatever that means. They don't seem to explain these updates very well.
