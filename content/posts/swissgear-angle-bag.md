I had a real hard time finding something that was small and non-bulky, yet had some extra room to carry a little more than just the tablet itself. This bag is made from neoprene and is very light. It is slightly larger than the X61T, but I think I'll be happy with it. It has a small pocket on the front that could hold maybe an extra battery or a power supply. It also has a strap on the back that you can slide over the pull handle on a rolling suitcase.</p>
