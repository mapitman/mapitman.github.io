Well, I finally bit the bullet and converted from .Text to dasBlog. Why did I convert? I didn't want to upgrade from .Text to Community Server. It just seems like overkill for my site. I don't need forums or support for multiple blogs. I also wanted to remove the dependency on SQL Server. I used <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/blogconverter/" target=_blank>DotText2DasBlog</A> to import my posts. It worked really well!
