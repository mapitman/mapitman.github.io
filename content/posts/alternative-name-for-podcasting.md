In Adam Curry's <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/2004/10/13.html" target="_blank">"Daily SourceCode" on Oct. 13th</a>,&nbsp;there's some talk about the name "Podcasting". Chris Pirillo <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/12/158729.html" target="_blank">talks about it too</a>. Some people don't like the name because it seems to tie it to the Apple iPod and leave out other MP3 players. What about calling it "Blogcasting"? It seems to have been born out of blogging, so it kinda makes sense. What do you think?
