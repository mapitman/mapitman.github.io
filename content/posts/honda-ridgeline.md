        <P>Recently we decided to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;popup tent trailer and we needed a new vehicle to tow it. We have three young children so I needed something with a backseat so I looked at the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and the Honda Ridgeline. I didn't like the way the Tacoma drove, so it was out of the running right away. The Frontier was OK, but nothing special really. As soon as I started driving the Ridgeline I knew that was the truck I wanted!</P>
<P>So, after much searching and haggling, I am the proud owner of a 2006&nbsp;Redrock Pearl Honda Ridgeline RTL + Moonroof! No pics yet, but I will post some soon...</P>
