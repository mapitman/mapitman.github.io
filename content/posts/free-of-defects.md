        &nbsp;I was reading a mailing list that I subscribe to when I came
across a job posting. In the "Job Responsibilites" I found this gem:<br>
<blockquote><i>Design, develop, and validate performance of&nbsp; work
to ensure that any software release is free of defects and does not
require an additional release to correct defects. <br>
  </i></blockquote>If they find someone who can do that, they should pay that person millions of dollars!<br>
