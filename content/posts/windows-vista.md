        <P>I took the plunge and installed Vista on my laptop today. I had installed the beta&nbsp;a couple of times a few months ago, but uninstalled pretty much immediately when I couldn't get the video drivers to work. My laptop is a Compaq Presario R3000 with an ATI Radeon Mobility 9600. I figured that now that it is out at retail, the drivers will surely have to work, right? Well, I'm still having problems. "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"</P>

<P>That's the driver that Vista installs. I also downloaded the "Catalyst" drivers from ATI and had the same results. Anyone know of a way to get my video chipset working properly under Vista? I'm going to stick with Vista this time; I really like the new features. I don't use my computer for gaming so the video isn't super important (I have my XBOX 360 for that). I'd just like to utilize the full resolution of my display and not have herky-jerky movement when I drag windows around!</P>
