<a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/" target="_blank">Sveasoft</a> is offering their <a href="http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=33&amp;scid=35&amp;prid=601" target="_blank">WRT54G</a> firmware for free. You can read about it <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/modules/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1626" target="_blank">here</a>. I like it because it allows you to configure certain options that weren't available in the official firmware. Like being able to select the NTP server to use. It also adds some things like <a href="http://www.openssh.org/" target="_blank">SSHD</a> and a <a href="http://www.poptop.org/" target="_blank">PPTPD</a> server. Although, I haven't been able to get the PPTPD server to allow me to connect yet. Maybe this new version will have that fixed. I was using an earlier version and haven't installed the latest one yet.<br />
