		<p>
		</p>I figured out my <a href="http://markpit.com/blog/ct.ashx?id=a629f313-ccf0-4bb4-ab87-47ea1df85076&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fmarkpit.com%2f2005%2f09%2f08%2fiTunes50AndOutlookSyncing.aspx" _base_href="http://markpit.com/blog/">problem with iTunes syncing my iPod contacts with Outlook</a>.
The 5.0.1 update of iTunes now pops up a message telling me why it
can't sync my contacts. Turns out I didn't have Outlook set as my
default email and contact manager. Once I did that, It started syncing
just fine.
