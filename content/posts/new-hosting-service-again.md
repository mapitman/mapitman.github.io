        <p>Well, my blog has been down for some time while I found a new host. My old 
one was FreeWebDot and I had a free account. It worked great until they got 
DOS'd and stopped their free service. I'm now on <a href="http://hostingatoz.com/">Hosting A To Z</a>. I had a few problems getting 
dasBlog running at first, but they were pretty quick to fix it. Hopefully I'll 
start posting some useful stuff here again soon.</p><p></p>
