<p>The fingerprint reader software on my ThinkPad X61T has stopped working at the Windows login screen. I've tried re-installing the software a couple of times, to no avail. So I have re-installed Vista and I'll be getting all the drivers installed again. This time I am not going to use the ThinkVantage system update software though. It never quite worked right.</p>
