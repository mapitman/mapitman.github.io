<P>I was using <A href="http://www.dasBlog.net">dasBlog </A>(for about a day and a half) but when I found out that trackbacks don't work or at least a number of people have problems getting them to work, I switched to <A href="http://scottwater.com/blog">.Text</A>. I hadn't posted too much yet so migration was pretty simple. I just re-posted what I had posted in dasBlog and changed the dates in the db.</P>
