<p>I went to an all day session on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx">Windows Azure</a> today at the Engineering Forum at work. It looks really slick and is pretty much a no brainer for .NET developers to use. I can see a lot of ASP.NET sites moving to it from other hosting companies... if the price is right!</p>
