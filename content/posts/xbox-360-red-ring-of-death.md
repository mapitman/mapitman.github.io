I turned on my XBOX 360 tonight and was met with a blank screen and 3 red lights around the power button. I found a web page that describes what to do <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/how-to-fix-your-xbox-360s-3-red-lights-of-death-217686.php">to fix it</a>. I was a little skeptical about picking up the console and smacking it though. I noticed a comment on that page talking about hard drive "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiction">stiction</a>" and remembered my days as a PC tech "fixing" old IBM PS/2 machines by removing the hard drive and smacking it with the palm of my hand. So, I removed the hard drive from the console and tried powering it up. It worked fine. So I smacked the drive a couple of times and reattached it to the console. I powered it up again it it worked fine. I hope this is a one time deal!<br>
