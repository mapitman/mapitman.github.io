<A href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2004/04/09/455.aspx">Tim Heuer</A> found a pretty cool <A href="http://www.nesterovsky-bros.com/html/css2/index.html">project</A> that allows you to use VSS over the Internet! I have used <A href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</A> and <A href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</A> that way before, but I was amazed that someone has wrapped up VSS and turned it into a client/server system. Looks like it&nbsp;can even integrate into VS.Net.
