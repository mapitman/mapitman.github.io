<p><a href="http://markpit.com/MyFeeds">MyFeeds</a> 1.19 is now available in the <a href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/" target="_blank">Windows Phone Marketplace</a>! If you donâ€™t see the latest version yet, be patient. I just published it so it may take a bit to show up. This is a very minor bugfix release. I am working on the 2.x code as well, which will have some new features. This release contains the following:</p> <ul> <li>Article has blank space at top when there was no image associated. Fixed.  <li>RSS feeds with no description tag cause app to crash. Fixed.  <li>RSS feeds using Cyrillic (windows-1251) codepage do not display properly. Fixed.</li></ul>
