After upgrading the firmware on my linksys router I had some <A href="http://epitman.com/blog/archive/2004/04/05/146.aspx">problems</A>, but by turning off UPnP and disabling logging, the router hasn't required a reboot for a few days now. Hopefully <A href="http://www.linksys.com">Linksys</A> will release a more stable firmware revision soon!
