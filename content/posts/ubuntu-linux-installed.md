        I got Ubuntu installed. It was pretty painless. The installer is very
easy to use and quick. Now I need to figure out which app to use to
manage my iPod. There are a number of choices. I want one that works
with pdocasts and syncs them properly to my iPod so they keep
bookmarks. After that i need to get my T-Mobile MDA to sync with
Evolution. If I can get those two things working, I think I'll be able
to stick with it this time.<p></p>
