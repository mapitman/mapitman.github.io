Mario Szpuszta recently posted an <A target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmsde/html/msdedepl.asp">article</A> to&nbsp;<A target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN</A> that talks about using the <A target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6e9a7403-c4ba-4d98-bb0b-2c9d6414071f&amp;DisplayLang=en">MSDE Deployment Toolkit</A>. I hadn't even realized it has been available since December, although it is only a release candidate. This should help out a lot of developers who want to use MSDE as a local data store for standalone apps or as an offline storage facility for networked apps. I was about ready to write some sort of front-end for the MSDE installer to use with the software we are writing at <A target="_blank" href="http://goalcentrix.com/">work</A>. Looks like I don't need to now. Thanks MS!
