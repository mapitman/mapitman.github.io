        <p></p>A couple of days ago, our webserver lost a hard drive.
Unfortunately, I didn't have a recent backup of my blog. I had been
using .Text previously and I told my friend who runs the server I
didn't need my site backed up, since all the data was in the database.
Then I switched over to dasBlog and I forgot about the fact that it
stores data in XML files. Anyway, I had some of my content files on my
local system from when I upgraded from version 1.7 to 1.8 of dasBlog.
Between that and the Google <a href="http://google.com/search?q=cache:markyologist.com">cache</a> of my main page, I was able to get all of my posts back. Thanks <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>!<br>
