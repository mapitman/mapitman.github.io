        <P>So, I got the router hooked up and it is working well so far. Someone <A href="http://markpit.com/blog/blog/archive/2004/06/09/189.aspx#191">pointed out</A> that there is a security related bug so I have flashed it with the <A href="http://www.linksys.com/download/firmware.asp?fwid=201">beta firmware</A> available from Linksys. I have no real way to measure this, but websites seem to come up faster with this router than the old one.</P>
<P>I'm looking forward to hacking this thing :)</P>
