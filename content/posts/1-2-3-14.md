        I noticed something weird the other day when I saw the new iPod advertisement with U2 performing <i>Vertigo</i>.
Bono starts out the song speaking Spanish, "Uno, dos, tres, catorce..."
Sounds like he is just counting off the start of the song, but that
translates to "One, two, three, fourteen" in English. Where did he
learn to count?!?<br /><br /> Update:Â  Thanks <a href="12314.aspx">Chris</a>! You're right, this is their 14th album, now it makes sense!
