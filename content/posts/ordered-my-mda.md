Well, my [Cingular 2125 sold on eBay](/cingular-2125-for-sale). I got a good price for it. I tried to get the [T-Mobile MDA](http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/21/mda-now-officially-really-actually-available-from-t-mobile/) from a T-Mobile store, but they were sold out. I tried to use the "My T-Mobile" site to upgrade my phone to the MDA, but they didn't even offer it. I checked almost every day to see if it would appear and today it finally did. I ordered it right away and it said I should have it in about 7 days!
