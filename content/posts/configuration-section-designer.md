I found this really cool
[Visual Studio add-in](http://www.codeplex.com/csd) today that allows
you to visually design a set of classes to handle custom configuration
sections in .NET config files. It builds the code and even creates an
XSD so you get Intellisense when typing in the config file. It saved me
a bunch of time. I always forget the ins and outs of the
ConfigurationSection classes and this add-in means I wonâ€™t have to go
look them up every time I want to do some custom configuration.
