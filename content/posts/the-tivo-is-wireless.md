		</p>I took the Netgear WG111 V2 back to Fry's tonight. While I was
standing in line I was talking to a guy about the network adapter and
how I needed the older version. He said I should check out PC Club. On
a whim I stopped at Best Buy on my way home to see if they had the
WG111 V1. I went to the wall where they have all their networking gear
and looked. I found a few adapters made by Netgear that looked a lot
like it and then down on the bottom shelf I found the one I was looking
for. I was surprised by how many they had, at least 20 or so. There's even
a sticker on the box that says "TiVo Compatable". Note to Best Buy; put
some of those wifi adapters on the shelf next to the TiVos! I would
have bought it the same day I bought the TiVo if they had done that!<br /><br />

Anyway, I got it home, plugged it in and it worked right off the bat.
I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't support WPA. I had just got
everything on my network configured with WPA recently and now I had to
go back to 128 bit WEP!
