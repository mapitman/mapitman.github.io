<p>After just short of a month, my ThinkPad X61T Tablet PC arrived last week. So far, I am pretty happy with it. The first thing I did was create the recovery discs and then flatten it. It came with Vista Ultimate 32 bit. I installed Vista Ultimate 64 bit. I found <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=144783" target="_blank">this guide</a> on doing a clean install on ThinkPads. It worked well and I am now running Vista 64 bit.</p>  <p>Why do I want to run 64 bit? Well, I installed 4 GB of RAM (max supported by the hardware) and I want to make use of all of it. I also plan on running virtual machines on this laptop. I'll run at least one VM for work because our VPN solution doesn't support Vista yet :(</p>  <p>So, what's the hardware configuration?</p>  <ul>   <li>Intel Core 2 Duo L7500 (1.6GHz, 4MB L2, 800 MHz FSB)</li>    <li>OCZ 4GB PC2-5400 DDR2 SDRAM 667MHz SODIMM (2 DIMM)</li>    <li>12.1&quot; MultiView + MultiTouch WVA XGA TFT (1024 x 768)</li>    <li>200GB SATA 7200 RPM Hard Drive with Hardware Disk Encryption</li>    <li>1GB Intel Turbo Memory</li>    <li>ThinkPad X6 Tablet UltraBase w/ 8X Dual Layer DVD Recorder</li>    <li>Integrated Bluetooth</li>    <li>Intel Wireless Wi-Fi Link 4965AGN</li>    <li>X60 8 Cell Li-Ion Battery</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://www.lenovo.com" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> is having a sale right now if you want to <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=329576204C9E42289967E79E0E7C9A2D" target="_blank">order</a> one.
