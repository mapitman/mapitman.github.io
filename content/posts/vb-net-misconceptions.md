<a href="http://blog.steeleprice.net/archive/2004/07/12/361.aspx" target="_blank">Steele has an interesting post</a> about some of the mis-conceptions about VB.NET. I agree with him about how outrageous the list is, but I still like C# syntax vs. VB syntax. Just a personal preference really. I feel silly typing things like "Friend" and "Me" when I write code ;)<br />
