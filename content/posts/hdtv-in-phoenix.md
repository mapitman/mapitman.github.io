Every so often I'll switch over to the antenna on my HD television&nbsp;to see what's being broadcast in HD. Right about the time that the Olympics started, I decided to see if I could pick up the HD signal. That's when I noticed that it seems that the local NBC affiliate, KPNX&nbsp;isn't coming in on my set. I also noticed that the two local PBS digital channels had disappeared. Has anyone else in the Phoenix area noticed this or is it just me? I contacted KPNX and they said they are still broadcasting their HD signal. I am picking up quite a few other channels and I am pretty close to the antennas on South Mountain, so I can't imagine I am having a problem with a "weak" signal.
