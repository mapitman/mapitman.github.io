I finally received my call from <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> on Friday regarding them sending me the <a href="http://markpit.com/blog/2006/03/16/OrderedMDAReceivedSDA.aspx">wrong phone</a>. They said they would get the MDA ordered that day and I should have it Monday or Tuesday. I have to send back the SDA within 14 days, so I'll be sending that today. I think I am going to have to call them again though because I got a text message confirming that my MDA had been ordered, but it looks like they charged me the "non-upgrade" price. This has really been a pain! I will say though, that every time I deal with someone from <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com">T-Mobile</a> on the phone, they are very pleasant and seem like they are genuinely trying to help me.
