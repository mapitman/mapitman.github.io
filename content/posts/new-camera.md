<P>I bought a new digital camera over the weekend. It's the <A href="http://www.canoneos.com/digitalrebel/index.html">Canon Digital Rebel</A>. If you haven't heard of it before, it is a digital SLR camera that can use ANY of the Canon EF lenses and a whole boatload of third-party lenses too. It can take photos at 6.3 megapixels and stores them on a compact flash card. <A href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2003_reviews/300d.html">Steve's Digicam can tell you more</A> about this camera than I can! All i can say so far is this thing just feels nice in your hands! It is replacing my <A href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/dx4900.html">Kodak DX4900</A>. It was a decent camera for a &#8220;point-and-shoot&#8221;, but it is no match for the Rebel! I'm no shutterbug, but so far my photos are turning out better with this camera than my old one. I think it may inspire me to take more photos of my family and friends. Maybe I'll even turn it into a hobby. Who knows?</P>
