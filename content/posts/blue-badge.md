<p>This week I started my new job at Microsoft. The first day and a half were devoted to New Employee Orientation (NEO as it is called here). I've been through orientation at a few different companies. I can definitely say this was the most informative and attention keeping.</p>  <p>This afternoon I met with my manager and got assigned my desk. My PC was all in pieces stacked up on my desk. I had to set it all up and install the OS and various apps. I think that's a great way to do it. Developers should know enough about PCs to handle doing that. Believe me, I've worked with some developers in the past who would have freaked out if they showed up to work and had to setup their own PC.</p>  <p>I'm pretty excited about what the future holds for me and my family here in Washington and at Microsoft!</p>
