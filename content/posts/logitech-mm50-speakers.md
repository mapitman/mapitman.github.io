<P>My wife recently got me the <A href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2414,CONTENTID=10785">Logitech mm50</A> speakers for my birthday. I can't believe how good they sound for their size. They run on a rechargable battery and allow you to "dock" your iPod right into them. When the unit is plugged in to the wall outlet, it will even recharge your iPod. Surprisingly, they put out a very decent level of bass. There is even a remote included. It doesn't seem to work real well from more than about 10 or 15 feet, but that's enough to keep you from getting up off the couch to skip tracks. </P><IMG src="http://markpit.com/blog/binary/mm50.png" border=0>
